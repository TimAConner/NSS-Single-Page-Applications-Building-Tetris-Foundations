# NSS-Single-Page-Applications-Building-Tetris-Foundations

## Motivation
This was Javascript practice done while attending the [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/).

## Synopsis / Instructions
Investigate the HTML5 canvas tag to build the 7 different Tetris game shapes. Display them somewhere on the canvas as a staging area. Outline a separate area in the canvas as the game area.

Allow the user to drag one of the shapes from the staging area to the game area. As soon as the user lets go of the mouse button, the shape should start moving towards the bottom of the game area.
